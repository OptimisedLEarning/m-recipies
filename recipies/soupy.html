        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>I'm showing you my take on what is considered one of the world's greatest soups. Which was invented, I hear, because British soldiers in India weren't able to start a meal without soup. This is incredibly hearty, savory, and comforting, and something that should be on every soup lover's bucket list. Serve with naan.

        <h2> Direction/Steps </h2>
        
        <ol> 
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt butter and oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs and season with salt; let brown for 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and brown on opposite side, 4 to 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>While chicken browns, combine curry powder, garam masala, cumin, black pepper, ground mustard, coriander, and cayenne in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove browned chicken from the pot and transfer to a plate to cool enough to handle; roughly chop or shred.</li>
            <li>While chicken cools, reduce heat to medium and add spice blend to pot; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onions, carrots, and celery. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until onions turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Stir in tomato paste and continue to cook for 3 minutes more.

            </li>
            <li>Stir in potatoes, tomatoes, and apples. Add red lentils, bay leaf, and tamarind paste.</li> 
            <li>Pour in chicken broth, stir, and raise heat to high; add coconut cream. Bring to a simmer. Stir and reduce heat to medium-low. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir chopped chicken and any accumulated juices into the soup. Continue to let simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are fully cooked, lentils are tender, and soup has thickened, 20 to 30 minutes more. Taste and adjust as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve in warm bowls topped with Greek yogurt, cilantro, and scallions. Sprinkle with red chili flakes.</li>
        </ol>
